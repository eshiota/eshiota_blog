# eshiota.com WordPress theme

This is the theme I'm using in [my site](http://www.eshiota.com/). Feel free to study its implementation and suggest code improvements.

This theme uses the [Compass gem](http://compass-style.org/), and while I strongly dislike the SASS synatx and avoid rules nesting (except on really useful cases), I do enjoy its CSS3 prefix helpers and how SASS' `@include` feature helps organizing the site's styles.

## Using Compass

### Installing

1. Install Ruby. Tip: do it [using RVM](http://beginrescueend.com/)
2. Setup the Ruby environment: `gem update --system`
3. Install Compass gem: `gem install compass`

### Using Compass

* All SCSS files are located in the `sass` folder.
* The `compass_config.rb` contains the compiling options used in the theme. You are free to change them.
* To generate the CSS files using the `compass_config.rb` options, type `compass compile -c compass_config.rb` while on the theme's folder.
* To watch the SCSS files and compile them on every change, type `compass watch -c compass_config.rb`.

## Theme roadmap

* Implement Category listing
